Ingredients:
 - 1 cup all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)
 - 1 tablespoon sugar
 - 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt
 - 1 1/2 cups whole milk
 - 4 large eggs
 - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions:

1. In a blender, combine flour, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, and butter.

2. Puree until mixture is smooth and bubbles form on top, about 30
seconds. Let batter sit at least 15 minutes at room temperature (or
refrigerate in an airtight container, up to 1 day; whisk before
using).

3. Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium. Lightly coat with
butter. Add 1/3 cup batter and swirl to completely cover bottom of
skillet. Cook until underside of crepe is golden brown, 2 to 3
minutes.

4. Loosen edge of crepe with a rubber spatula, then with your
fingertips, quickly flip. Cook 1 minute more. Slide crepe out of
skillet and repeat with remaining batter. (Coat pan with butter as
needed.)
